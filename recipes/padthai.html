        <li>1 ½ teaspoons garlic, minced</li>   
        <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 cup coarsely ground peanuts</li>

        <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in eggs; scramble until eggs are nearly cooked through, about 2 minutes. Add chicken and rice noodles and stir until well combined.</li>
        <li>Stir in tamarind mixture, 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar, and salt; cook until noodles are tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in peanuts and cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Garnish with bean sprouts, chives, and paprika; serve with lime wedges.</li>
