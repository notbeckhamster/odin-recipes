    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Teriyaki chicken is a Japanese dish with teriyaki sauce. The sauce is made by mixing and heating soy sauce, sake, or mirin; and sugar (or honey or corn syrup) until it thickens. The word teriyaki derives from the noun teri (照り), which refers to a shine or luster given by the sugar content in the tare (タレ), and yaki (焼き), which refers to the cooking method of grilling or broiling.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>1 cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup mirin (Japanese sweet wine)</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>   
        <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol> 
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Whisk cornstarch and water together in a small bowl until dissolved; set aside. Combine soy sauce, sugar, mirin, ginger, garlic, and red pepper flakes together in a saucepan over medium heat until the mixture starts to simmer. Slowly whisk in cornstarch mixture. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until thickened, stirring often, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pat chicken dry with paper towels; arrange in a baking dish. Pour sauce over chicken breasts, coating all sides.</li>
        <li>Bake chicken breasts in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
